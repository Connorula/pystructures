Because I've realized a lot of my project is in-depth research into optimization,
I will keep a log of the research I do to supplement my commits.
Weekend of 1/27/2018
-Reviewed built-in data structure source code in cpython
-C practice: Generic implementation of stack and linked lists
-Research stacks, decided I will implement stacks using a linked lists
-Began writing my stack.c
1/29/2018
-Spent two hours working on a stack struct before finding an effective open source library
-Will customize and then wrap in C, better than starting from scratch
