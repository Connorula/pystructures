# ExtendedDataStructures
The goal of project is to aid developers in the use of data structures.
##Python Builtin Data Structures
The builtin data structures in Python: lists, tuples, dictionaries, strings, sets and frozensets.

Lists, strings and tuples are ordered sequences of objects. Unlike strings that contain only characters, list and tuples can contain any type of objects. Lists and tuples are like arrays. Tuples like strings are immutables. Lists are mutables so they can be extended or reduced at will. Sets are mutable unordered sequence of unique elements whereas frozensets are immutable sets.
